IA4580 Project Milestone 1: Project Requirements analysis and planning

Executive Project Summary  
Problem statement
One of the major issues we have noticed in existing restaurant ordering applications is security concerns. Customers wants there data to be remained secure while they order food from a restaurant. This is the main motivation for this project, using Paypal Payment Gateway the customers will easily make orders in a reliable way. 
Goals:
Our goal is to provide users a secure and reliable restaurant ordering app that can entertain 1000s of users at a time without crashing or losing its performance. Hence, secure restaurant ordering app aims to increase customer satisfaction up to 90% in first 3 months. On the other hand, the complete tested project will be delivered in 4 months after the contract sign. 
Merit of the project 
The most important asset of any business organization is their customers, so we want our customers to have trust on this application in terms of security and safety of their confidential data. In online applications customers wants their credit card information to be highly secured and hack proof. To gain the long term benefits and customer satisfaction our main focused will be the software architecture that need to hack proof by using appropriate software architectural styles.
